        <p style="color:black;">The Raspberry Pi launched in 2012, and there have been several iterations and variations released since then.<br>
             The original Pi had a single-core 700MHz CPU and just 256MB RAM, and the latest model has a quad-core CPU clocking in at over 1.5GHz, and 4GB RAM.<br> 
            The price point for Raspberry Pi has always been under $100 (usually around $35 USD), most notably the Pi Zero, which costs just $5.</p>
            <p>All over the world, people use the Raspberry Pi to learn programming skills, build hardware projects, <br>do home automation, implement Kubernetes clusters and Edge computing, and even use them in industrial applications.</p>
                <br>
                The Raspberry Pi operates in the open source ecosystem: it runs Linux (a variety of distributions), and its main supported operating system, Pi OS, is open source and runs a suite of open source software. 
                <br>The Raspberry Pi Foundation contributes to the Linux kernel and various other open source projects as well as releasing much of its own software as open source.

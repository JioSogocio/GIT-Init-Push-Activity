    <p style="color:black;">Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects.</p>
    <p>Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) <br>
        and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) <br>
        that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.<br>
        Arduino is a great tool for people of all skill levels. However, you will have a much better time learning along side your 
        <br>Arduino if you understand some basic fundamental electronics beforehand.<br>
         We recommend that you have at least a decent understanding of these concepts before you dive in to the wonderful world of Arduino.</p>

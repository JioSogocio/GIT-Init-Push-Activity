        <p style="color:black;">A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
            <br> The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure or any number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to a human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.</p>
        <p>The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure or any number of other environmental phenomena.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sensors can be categorized in multiple ways. One common approach is to classify them as either active or passive. An active sensor is one that requires an external power source to be able to respond to environmental input and generate output.
            <br> For example, sensors used in weather satellites often require some source of energy to provide meteorological data about the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
